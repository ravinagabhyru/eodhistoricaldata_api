Version 0.2.0
 * Most of the fields of `HistoricQuote` are now optional. This way, reading the full history
   does not break even if some values have null values. For realtime quotes, it is still 
   a valid approach to return an error, since the quote would probably of no use anyway

Version 0.1.1
 * Small extensions to increase usability

Version 0.1.0
* Initial setup of project
* Implementation of request for single quotes and quote history
* Unit tests for single quotes and quote history
